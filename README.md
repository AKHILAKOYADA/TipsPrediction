1. Create a ML Project Folder in PC/Laptop
2. Create environment in the folder
To create we use python -m venv folder_name
3. Activate the environment
to activate we use ./folder_name/scripts/activate
4. Create backend folder, frontend folder and Readme.md file
5. In Backend we created load_data folder, train_model folder, requirements.txt app.py, pickle file, train_save.py
6. In frontend we created app.py and requirements.txt

# Inside Load data, we created a file load_data.py and in train_model created a file train_model.py

# After creating the files we created train_save.py and loaded the requirements.txt
# tO load libaries we use pip install -r requirements.txt
# after this we ran our train_save.py which created pkl file

# run the app.py
# start another terminal to use the files related to frontend
# again we have to activate the environment
In frontend we created requirements.txt and app.py 
before we run we will load the labraries which is required in the frontend folder
# after loading the libraries we ran the app.py in frontend through streamlit
# to run streamlit we use dtreamlit run file-name.py
# Push to github 
# git Init
